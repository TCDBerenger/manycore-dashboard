		<h4>Scope</h4>
		<p>
			For the purpose of this work, we make assumptions
			about the type of multicore computer where the performance problems occur on. We're looking at the kind of machine that is found
			on the typical desktop: A machine with multiple cores and a shared
			memory with hardware cache coherency, and which runs an operating
			system. We assume a shared-memory programming model based on threads,
			with locks, barriers, semaphores, critical sections and similar
			mechanisms as the main synchronization mechanism. The machine might
			have multiple CPU chips, but all operate on a shared memory with cache
			coherency.

			The cores of the machine may support hardware multithreading; that is
			a single core may be able to execute more than one thread either by
			switching thread every machine cycle (classical multithreading), or by
			intermixing instructions from more than one thread in the execution
			pipeline. <a href="assets/common/survey.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a>
