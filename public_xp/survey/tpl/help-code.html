		<h2>Data Locality</h2>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Locality of reference, also known as the principle of locality, is a phenomenon describing the same value, or related storage locations, being frequently accessed. There are two basic types of reference locality â€“ temporal and spatial locality. Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data, and/or resources, within a relatively small time duration. Spatial locality refers to the use of data elements within relatively close storage locations. Sequential locality, a special case of spatial locality, occurs when data elements are arranged and accessed linearly, such as, traversing the elements in a one-dimensional array.</a></p>

			<p>Consider a hypothetical computer with a fast, single-line cache of <b>8 bytes</b> (analogous to a CPU cache) and a slow buffer (analogous to RAM) in which a 4x4 greyscale image data resides to illustrate the example. This simplified cache system can only cache data in blocks of 8 bytes (an 8-byte cache line).</p>

			<p>First iteration of the loop touches 4 bytes (#0, #4, #8 and #12), two cache misses occur including the first load, as the image data needs to be loaded from memory into the cache line for CPU to use it. During the entire execution of the program, the total of 8 cache misses occurs. This means that our hypothetical CPU loads 8 * 8 = 64 bytes in total from our slow buffer into the cache.</p>
