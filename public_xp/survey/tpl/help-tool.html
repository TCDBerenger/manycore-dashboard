		<p class="alert alert-info">You will now be presented with a visualisation tool that shows performance data along with the source-code of the programs. Please read the following to understand how the visualisation work and what is shown on the screen.</p>

		<h2>Proportional View</h2>
		<p>This view allows you to compare various components as a proportional estimation of CPU activity, adding up to 100%. The pane on the left allows to show/hide unnecessary dimensions and applies the selection to every view on the screen.</p>

		<hr />
		<h2>Timeline View</h2>
		<p>This view allows you to visualise the programs running over time. The color-scheme is exactly the same as in the proportional view showed above.</p>

		<hr />
		<h2>Worker View</h2>
		<p>This view allows you to see the same data per thread. Each line represents a particular thread and each line can be colored by:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Locality</b>: a function that represents the effectiveness of data-locality patterns, variying from green to red. Green represents an optimal data locality (ie: low cache and tlb misses and no page faults) while red represents the opposite.</li>
				<li><b>Process</b>: each thread is colored by the process it belongs to.</li>
				<li><b>Thread</b>: each thread is given a unique color.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the previous dimensions that represent CPU Activity (eg: Loading from L2) there are "Thread", "Process" and "Core Time". The first two axes show the thread ID and the process it belongs to while the <b>"Core Time"</b> shows a percentage of time the thread has spent on a core, executing code or waiting for data.
		</p>
		<p>Finally, as you can see on the image below, it is possible to refine the data by clicking and dragging on a particular axis.</p>
